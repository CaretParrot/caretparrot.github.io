            <p>Rishi Venkatesh is a concert and electronic music composer that has gained prominence through the
                performances of <em>Adagio For String Orchestra & Harp</em> and <em>Fantasia For Viola & String
                    Orchestra</em> with the Blue Valley Northwest Chamber Symphony. He is also a two-time winner of the
                KMEA Jeff Jordan Composition Competition. <br><br>
                His music provides a unique blend of styles from across the music diaspora. From the lush textures of
                classical music and modern romanticism, to the experimental fields of jazz and film music, Rishi aims to
                preserve the legacy of
                classical music while pushing its boundaries to achieve experiences that can both comfort and challenge
                the ear of the listener.<br><br>
                Rishi Venkatesh is also the founder of The Composers Foundry, an online community dedicated to fostering
                the development of music composition and theory amongst young composers, theorists, arrangers, and
                enthusiasts. More information can be found on their <a href="https://discord.gg/hAd2mcstZe">Discord
