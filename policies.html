            <h2>Premiere Program</h2>
            <p>Performers that give a performance of any of my unpremiered works may receive reimbursement for
                their music costs, and may be eligible for additional compensation depending on performance
                quality. Potential compensation and reimbursement are contingent on the creation of a publicly
                available
                recording of the newly premiered work. The recording must be of a sufficiently high quality, both
                from
                the performers and from the recording technology. Generally, more demanding works will also demand a
                higher quality of playing and recording.<br><br>
                Please keep in mind that many of my unpremiered works will need to be revised before they get sent.
                This
                means that a performer requesting to premiere a piece may have to wait <strong>several weeks or
                    months</strong> before receiving their music, depending on my personal schedule and length of
                work.
                If you wish to premiere a work, <strong>do not wait</strong>. Please fill out the form at the end of
                this page. <strong>Only works marked as "Unpremiered" in the database above are eligible.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>This policy is subject to modification over time.</strong>
                Please check <a href="https://discord.gg/hAd2mcstZe">The Composers Foundry</a> for any premiere
                requests
                that I make.

            <h2>Photocopying</h2>
            <p>The act of photocopying my music or distributing photocopies is prohibited, unless photocopying is done to "fill out" a section of players. For example, performers are permitted to purchase one copy of a Violin I, Violin II, Viola, Cello, or Double Bass part and photocopy for the rest of the section.</p>
